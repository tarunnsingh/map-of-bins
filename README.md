### :speech_balloon: An APP to make our Cities Clean and Garbage Free.

## The Idea :thinking:
The sole idea is to motivate the citizens using the app, to use dustbins regularly while disposong waste. This has been a common saying, but we have put in a Reward Sysytem which would basicaly increase the chances for a person to use a dustbin, as he would be rewarded on doing so.

## The App and it's working explained :computer:  
We have created a Web Application, with the usual client-server architecture. The users would be able to see a *map* on the homepage, which would populate the nearby dustbins on the map depending on their proximity to the user's location (fetched from the browser). The user would then be prompted to go to that dustbin and drop the waste materials in it. When the user does that, we would cross-verify it using some information sent by the sensors on the dustbin. Once confirmed the user would then be awarded some **reward points**.
